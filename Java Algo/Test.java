/**
* Note that software testing hastwo core aspects to it:
*
*
* Manual vs. Automated Testing: In an ideal world, we might love to automate every- thing, but that's rarely feasible. Some things are simply much better with manual testing because some features are too qualitative for a computer to effectively examine (such as if content represents pornography). Additionally, whereas a computer can generally recognize only issues that it's been told to look for, human observation may reveal new issues that haven't been specifically examined. Both humans and computers form an essential part of the testing process.
*
*BlackBox Testing vs. White Box Testing:This distinction refers to the degree of access we have into the software. In black box testing, we're just given the software as-is and need to test it. With white box testing, we have additional programmatic access to test individual functions. We can also automate some black box testing, although it's certainly much harder.
*
* Testing a piece of Software
* 1. Black or White box?
* 2. who? why?
* 3. use cases?
* 4. bounds of use cases?
* 5. failure conditions?
* 6. structured manner to perform test cases?
* 
* Test a Function
* 1. define test cases: normal case, extreme case, null and illegal, strange case
* 2. Define the expected result: right output and side effects like parameter untouched
* 3. Write test code
*
* Troubleshooting Questions
* 1. Understand the scenario: how long experience? version? OS? steps? error report launch?
* 2. Break Down the problem
* 3. Create specific and manageable tests for users or yourself
